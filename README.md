# First project with Auth0 and React

This repo is based on the very good Auth0 and React tutorial provided on 
the Auth0 site available [here](https://auth0.com/blog/react-tutorial-building-and-securing-your-first-app/)

### Execution notes

I am likely to forget the syntax for creating a new React app so I wanted
to have it in the notes.

```bash
npx create-react-app <foo>
```
